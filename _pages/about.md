Hi, I'm Oto, an incoming PhD student at TU Delft in the field of Scalable Cloud Applications under the supervision of Prof. Asterios Katsifodimos. Prior to my PhD I completed my Computer Science BSc. at King's College London and my Data Science MSc. at ETH Zurich. After that I spent 1 year in industry as an IT consultant reponsible for developing and maintaining an Apache Kafka cluster at a private investment bank. My research interests lie at the intersection of Data Processing, Data Intergation, and Machine Learning.
