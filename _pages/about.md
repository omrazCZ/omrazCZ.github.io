Hi, I'm Oto, a PhD candidate at TU Delft in the field of Scalable Cloud Applications under the supervision of Dr. Asterios Katsifodimos. Prior to my PhD, I completed my Computer Science BSc. at King's College London and my Data Science MSc. at ETH Zurich. After that I spent 1 year in industry as an IT consultant responsible for developing and maintaining an Apache Kafka cluster at a private investment bank. My research interests lie at the intersection of Databases, Data Processing, and Data Management.
