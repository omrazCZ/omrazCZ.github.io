In this project I supervised 5 MSc students conducting a literature review on the topic Benchmarking Geo-Distributed Databases.

In this project students were given an individual sub-topic to focus on. Under my guidance, they looked for traits, issues and proposed solutions to the problems of benchmarking in a geo-distributed settings. Finally, they compiled their gained insigts into a 3-page literature survey.
