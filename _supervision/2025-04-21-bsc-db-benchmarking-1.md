In this project I supervised 5 BSc students implementing, evaluating and analyzing 5 geo-distributed databases each on a different benchmark.

In this project they had to:

- Reimplement a benchmark within the Detock codebase
- Run experiments with five databases systems on six benchmarking scenarios
- Analyze the experimental results
