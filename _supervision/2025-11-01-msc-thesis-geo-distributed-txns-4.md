In this project I will supervise a MSc student in his thesis on Geo-distributed Transactional Functions as a Service in Styx. The student will profile the performance of Styx specifically in the case geo-distirbution (which the associated difficulty of extra cross-regional latency, different types of failures, etc.). He will then implement new concurrency control protocols aiming to optimize for geo-distributed systems.
